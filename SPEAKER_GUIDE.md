## Speaker guide for CNCF & Kubernetes meetups

First off, thank you for volunteering to speak at our meetups!
Your contributions are very appreciated, and is what keeps us all moving forward.

#### Respect the Community

We'd like to remind everybody (especially speakers and sponsors) that these meetups
are **community events**. We're here to discuss problems, ideas, solutions and technical
challenges ahead to better understand each other and move forward together. We're **not**
attending meetups to pitch or sell any products, to favor a specific company's solutions,
or to talk badly about competitors. This is a good place to say that _all our meetups_
**follow the [CNCF][cncf-coc] and [The Linux Foundation][lf-coc] Code of Conducts**.

#### Before the meetup

 - Apply to speak at Cloud Native Nordics meetup, currently depends on the individual group. Click on the specific group to find out how to apply. 
 - Discuss any outstanding questions with the organizer and accept the speaking slot,
   preferably the title and short abstract shall be available around a week before the meetup.

#### At the meetup

 - (Optional) Bring your company's or favorite project's swag, e.g. stickers to the "swag table".
