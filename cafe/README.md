# Cloud Native Nordics Café :coffee:

We're starting a new social event: Cloud Native Nordics Café

The idea is a casual hangout after lunch without any specific topic, you just join the call (not recorded) and talk if you want to or just listen in. We will figure out as we go.

Bring a cup of coffee or whatever you prefer, and hangout with fellow Cloud Natives :slightly_smiling_face: Feel free to ask any questions, propose any topics, problems you are facing.

This is hopefully a good way to socialize a bit in these lock-down times we are facing at the moment.

We will kick this of today at 12:30 CET / 13:30 EET (actually, we're live now!).
