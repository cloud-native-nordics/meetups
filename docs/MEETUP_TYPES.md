# Meetup types

This document seeks to provide a guide and inspiration for different types of meetups. 

## Level of experience

When doing a meetup it is good to evaluate which level of experience is needed to participate.
Deep dives are fun for more experienced participants where as 101 talks will attract new comers.
It is important that you cater both groups to have a steady flow of beginners enter your meetups and keep the more experienced participants entertained.

## 1. Normal (2 x 45 min)

This meetup type consist of 2 talks with a 45 minute duration. It allows the speaker to go into details of the subject and do deep dives. 

## 2. 3 x 30 min

This meetup type consist of 3 talks with a 30 minute duration. It is good for introductions to new areas while still going into detail.
To make this type work well you have to consider a common thread.

Ideas:
* Talks within the same vicinity e.g. Observability in Kubernetes could include talks about monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing.
* 101 talks to introduce new CNCF projects

## 3. Lightning talks (6 x 15 min)

This meetup type consist of 6 lightning talks with 15 minute duration each. It is a great format for introducing new concepts at a high-level. 

Ideas:   
* Ask community members to choose a CNCF project an do an introduction of the project and reflect on the usage. Have them introduce their findings as a lightning talk.

## 4. Open space (2 x 45 min)

This meetup type consists of 2 time slots with dedicated time to discuss topics. In the beginning of the meetup, have the participants propose ideas, write them on post-it notes, and put them on a board. Now make all the participants vote on their favorite topics (dot vote). Depending on the number of participants choose 2-3 concurrent subjects to be discussed. Participants form groups and discuss the selected topic. After 45 minute, have a break and continue with the next topics.

Example of meetup description for an Open Space meetup can be found in [MEETUP_DESCRIPTION.md](MEETUP_DESCRIPTION.md#Open-Space)

## 5. Workshops

Introduce a specific project or concepts. Use already created workshops, `workshopctl` to spin up kubernetes environments, etc. 
Have 2-5 facilitators / helpers ready to help participants when they get stuck or have questions.

Ideas:
* Hackaton on Kubernetes or Prometheus

## 6. Panel

Select 4-5 people to be on a panel on a specific subject.
Select 1-2 facilitators which will ensure the process on how the panel answers the questions, moderating time etc.
Create questions in advance to kick start things and make the participants of the meetup come up with their own questions.
This can be either a 30 or 45 min session.

Ideas:
* Observability panel discussing the trend
