# Cloud Native Stories - a virtual sharing session :book:

We're organizing the first virtual "sharing stories" panel discussion: Cloud Native Nordics Stories!

Join us for a relaxed panel conversation about what Cloud Native means for us, and stories about how to “do it” in practice. 

Lucas Käldström will be moderating, sharing stories will be;
 - Hans Duedal, @hd (Unity)
 - Kasper Nissen, @phennex (Lunar)
 - Jessica Andersson, @Jessica (Meltwater)
 - Laszlo Fogas, @Laszlo Fogas (laszlo.cloud)

Join the livestream on YouTube https://youtu.be/6nniWxL-ss4 and ask your questions in the chat!

As this is a completely new format, please let us know if you have any feedback!
No registration needed and for once no capped number of attendees on the meetup! \o/

*P.S.* If you’d also like to participate as a panelist and share your stories in this kind of casual livestream, feel free to fill in this form https://forms.gle/21V6EtZgR7JZ5urKA :slightly_smiling_face:
